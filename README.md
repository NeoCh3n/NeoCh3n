### Hi there 👋

**NeoCh3n/NeoCh3n** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **AI-driven detection systems** and **security automation** in the financial sector.
- 🛡 Background: ex-SOC analyst, now a **Technology Risk / AI Security** engineer with an M.Sc. in Data Analytics & AI (Hong Kong).
- 🌱 Exploring **log pipelines, ML-based threat detection**, and preparing for the **OSCP** exam.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on:
  - detection engineering / SOC tooling  
  - log analysis & security data pipelines  
  - AI-assisted incident response / agent-native security ideas
- 😄 Pronouns: **he / him / his**


### 🌌 Long-term interests

In the long run, I’m interested in building and operating **high-assurance security and detection systems** for high-stakes environments — especially **trading firms, hedge funds, and large-scale financial platforms**. 

I’m particularly curious about:

- how **offensive security** and **formal threat modelling** translate into practical detections in low-latency, high-volume systems  
- using **AI/ML to augment blue teams**, not replace them  
- bridging the gap between **security engineering, quantitative systems, and real-world risk management**
